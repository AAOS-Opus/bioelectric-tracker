# Fracture Report: [Project Name]
## Pre-K2 Risk Identification | [Date]

### Purpose

This document identifies potential failure points in the integration architecture before K2's formal resilience analysis. These are architect-identified concerns, not validated failure modes.

### Identified Fracture Lines

#### FR-001: [Title]
- Location: [Which layer/system]
- Concern: [What might break]
- Architect's Hypothesis: [Why this might be a problem]
- Suggested Investigation: [What K2 should examine]

#### FR-002: [Title]
- Location: [Which layer/system]
- Concern: [What might break]
- Architect's Hypothesis: [Why this might be a problem]
- Suggested Investigation: [What K2 should examine]

#### FR-003: [Title]
- Location: [Which layer/system]
- Concern: [What might break]
- Architect's Hypothesis: [Why this might be a problem]
- Suggested Investigation: [What K2 should examine]

### Handoff to K2

These fracture lines are hypotheses. K2 will validate, expand, or dismiss them during resilience analysis.
