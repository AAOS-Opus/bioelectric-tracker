# Bioelectric Tracker Trainer Knowledge Base

## Application Purpose

The Bioelectric Tracker is a specialized tool designed to support users undergoing a bioelectric regeneration program. It bridges the gap between subjective wellness experiences and quantifiable data, helping users track their consistency with protocols (supplements, device usage) and the resulting changes in their physical and emotional state.

## Core Concepts

### What is Bioelectric Regeneration?
It refers to the use of subtle energy and frequency technologies (like Scalar waves or PEMF) to support the body's natural healing and regenerative processes. This app tracks the *inputs* (device time, supplements) and the *outputs* (biomarkers).

### What are the Four Phases?
1.  **Foundation:** Preparing the body. Focus on detox and stabilization.
2.  **Integration:** incorporating consistent bioelectric inputs.
3.  **Optimization:** Fine-tuning protocols for maximum effect.
4.  **Mastery:** Maintenance and intuitive management of one's bioelectric state.

### What are Modalities?
*   **Spooky Scalar:** A device creating a scalar energy field for passive treatment.
*   **MWO (Multi-Wave Oscillator):** A device used for short, intense frequency sessions.
*   **PEMF:** Pulsed Electromagnetic Field therapy.
*   **Red Light:** Photobiomodulation therapy.

### What are Biomarkers?
These are the vital signs of the user's subjective experience. Unlike a blood test, these are self-reported ratings (1-10) of Energy, Sleep, Mood, Digestion, etc., which reveal trends over time.

## Feature-by-Feature Teaching Guide

### How to Explain: Daily Progress Notes

**Simple Explanation:**
"Think of this as your wellness diary—quick numbers for your body, and a short story for your mind."

**Detailed Explanation:**
"The Daily Progress Note is where you capture the nuance of your day. The sliders give us hard data we can graph to see if your sleep is improving over weeks. The text box is for anything that doesn't fit on a scale—like a specific dream or a reaction to a new food. Using both gives you the complete picture."

**Common Questions:**
-   **Q:** "Do I have to write a note every day?"
-   **A:** "No, but we recommend at least filling out the sliders (Biomarkers) to keep your charts accurate."
-   **Q:** "Can I add my own things to track?"
-   **A:** "Yes! Use the 'Add Biomarker' button to track things like 'Headache' or 'Libido'."

**Troubleshooting:**
-   **If** user says "I forgot to save," **then** explain the auto-save feature (runs every 30 seconds) but encourage hitting the save button to be sure.

### How to Explain: Product/Protocol Tracking

**Simple Explanation:**
"Your daily checklist for supplements and detox items."

**Detailed Explanation:**
"This section matches the physical items you are taking. Checking them off here builds your 'Compliance Score,' which is just a fancy way of saying 'Consistency.' High consistency often leads to better results."

## User Skill Levels

### Beginner (Week 1)
-   **Focus on:** Logging "Product" usage (checkboxes) and basic Biomarkers (Energy/Sleep).
-   **Avoid overwhelming with:** Adding Custom Biomarkers or deep trend analysis.
-   **Key learning goals:** Establishing the habit of daily login.

### Intermediate (Month 1)
-   **Introduce:** Modality Session logging when they start using devices.
-   **Deepen understanding of:** The "Biomarker Trends" chart—looking for correlations (e.g., "Compliance went up, and 3 days later Energy went up").

### Advanced (Ongoing)
-   **Full utilization:** Detailed correlation of specific Modalities to specific Biomarker spikes.
-   **Activity:** Customizing the dashboard view (if supported) and managing detailed Phase progression.
